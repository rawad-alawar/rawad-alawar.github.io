  <h1> "From H-town to Wellington 01/14/2015"</h1>
   The DBA/EDA experience is unique in how it cuts out the unnecessary information that is taught in universities and gets right into the meat of the subject matter. It is immediately practical. Furhtermore, the EDA emphasizes engineering empathy which is lost upon many university programming programs. Engineering empathy is a crucial component of programming because it portends an ability to work in teams and with others. Teamwork is more important than supreme technical knowledge; I think I would work well in this type of culture. My expectations have not changed. 

   I am beyond excited to join the program and am not the least bit nervous.

    <h1> "Time Management and Habits 01/14/2015"</h1>
     <p>I like the time box method for completing. I am currently working with another student and the methods described in the guide are similar to how we work. We pre arrange a box of time, usually around three hours, that is dedicated to doing work. If we do not finish, we schedule the work for later. This helps us avoid getting into an unproductive period of work that can accompany working towards a goal. I want to experiment with shorter time intervals. The guide mentioned the speed dating technique which involved 7 minute work sessions. I am  curious as to whether that is enough time to accomplish anything; perhaps it would work if the goals become more specific. I will experiment more. </p>

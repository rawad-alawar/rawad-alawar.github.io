    <h1> Time Management and Habits 01/14/2015</h1>
     <p>A big takeaway from Chade-Meng Tan's talk was his belief that emotional intelligence is a skill that can be trained. Therefore, anyone can increase their emotional intelligence with practice, just like any other skill. I learned about the components of emotional intelligence such as self awareness, self regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. I was surprised that intrapersonal skills were included in EI. I thought it was just interpersonal skills before watching the video. I like how half of the top six factors that make a great engineer are related to emotional intelligence rather than just book smarts. I also like how the two speakers support development of emotional intelligence skills with scientific studies. The three principles 1) Emotional skills are trainable. 2) Start with training Attention 3) Emotions are in both the brain and body. </p>
     <p>I found the two minutes of mindfulness to be a huge stress reliever. I did not know what was bothering me today, but clearing my mind allowed me to pinpoint it and that alone makes me feel better.</p>

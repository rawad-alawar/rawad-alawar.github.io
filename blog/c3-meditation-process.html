    The process over product concept helped me be less frustrated with how my website looks when compared to other peoples. I have accepted that I am learning right now and I am not a web design master yet.

    Before watching the Google video on meditation, I had associated meditation with Buddhists or ninjas. I did not think it was something that could help everyone. I learned that meditation creates a clear mind, and that a clear mind leads to happiness. This is because the "default" state of the mind is happiness. I found that to be beautiful.  I also learned that there is no wrong way to meditate. The mental training in meditation comes from snapping mind back into a clear state. Meditation has positive physical implications as well. It releives stress levels which thereby strengthens the imune response. I like the suggested process of mindfull meditation in which one follows their breath, gets distracted, then regains attention. I am glad that you do not have to follow the optimal meditation posture because I am not that flexible.

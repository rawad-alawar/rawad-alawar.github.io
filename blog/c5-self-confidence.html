      <h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
      <p>Self-awareness is a type of mindfulness. Mindfulness is defined as "the quality or state of being aware of something." With regards to the book, that "something", is our mind, body, and environment. Self-awareness is defined as "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions." So, if someone is practicing self-awareness, he or she is also practicing mindfulness.

      <p>I have been journaling since before reading Search Inside Yourself and have always found it to be an excellent method for discovering what is bothering me, if anything. Journaling allows me to jot down all my thoughts and concerns in one spot, thereby giving my mind a chance to not worry about remembering everything.</p>
      <p>My main takeaway from the chapter is that self-awareness is mindfulness./p>

      <h1>Pleasure Passion Purpose</h1>
      <p>Life through the pleasure, passion, and purpose lens looks looks similar to my life now. I joined EDA because I want to be a coder for humanity and create code which makes peoples' lives better. I do not have a formal education in computer science but I am enjoying solving the problems in our sprints. The books describes flow as a component of passion where "peak performance meets peak engagement." Often times while working through coding exercises I enter flow and time flies. It feels great. 
</p>
      <ul>My Core Values
      <li>niceness</li>
      <li>kindness</li>
      <li>inquisitiveness</li>
      <li>always getting better</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are more, but those four present themselves most often in my life. I stand for making the world a better place by improving peoples lives via technology. The resilience ideas really helped put failure into perspective, particularly with the insight that negative experiences exert themselves far more powerfully than positive experiences.

      <h1>Connecting</h1>
      <p>One method for building trust that I plan to use immediately is the Three Assumptions. When I was reading that portion of the chapter, I thought about how the meetings I have in my week now and if I am applying the three assumptions at every meeting. In particular, I plan on applying this method to the next check in. The Three Assumption are: 
      <ol>
        <li> Assume that everybody in this room is here to serve the greater good, until proven otherwise.</li>
        <li> Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that none of us has any hidden agenda, until
        proven otherwise.</li>
        <li> Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that we are all reasonable even when we
        disagree, until proven otherwise.</li>
      </ol>
Using these three assumptions will help me trust and understand my cohort mates. The first one seems easy enough because as I've gotten to know my classmates, I have become increasingly convinced that we are all here to serve the greater good, not just ourselves. Furthermore, I can not expect others to believe my intentions if I do not believe in theirs. The second and third assumptions are also important because they ensure we are all judged fairly and with understanding; they help us overcome any tendency to label an idea as "stupid" without first understanding the other persons perspective. I believe once I apply these assumptions to other people, I will never come across a "stupid" idea again.</p>

<p>Search Inside Yourself is truly a transformative book. When I first started going through the exercises in the earlier chapters, I was not totally convinced they would do as they claimed before I practiced them. But chapter after chapter, this book has been dead on. The loving kindness meditation helped me build kind thoughts towards people I never thought I would feel that way towards. It was amazing.

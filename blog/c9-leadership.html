      <h1>Leadership</h1>
      
      <h3>My Experience with Compassionate Leadership</h3>
      <p>In my first job after college, my department did not have a manager. I reported to the head of my division, and, so long as I finished my projects on time, my work hours were flexible. When I got word that the company had hired a new manager, I was somewhat disappointed and worried because I thought he was going to change my routine. The first time I met him, I realized he was a different kind of manager. He took our entire team out to lunch and dedicated that day to getting to know us better. I didn't know at the time, but he was investing in his relationship with us as a team and individually. Most importantly, whenever he asked me how I was doing, I knew it was not an empty question. He cared. And, because he cared me, I wanted to provide the best quality work that I could. My former boss epitomized compassionate leadership.

      <h3>Multiplying Goodness Meditation
      </h3>
      <p>See goodness in others, give goodness to all, multiply the goodness. Those are the premises of the multiplying goodness meditation. I had a little bit of difficulty at first visualizing the goodness I was breathing in and exhaling, so I did some mindful meditation to refocus. Once I got into rhythm, I felt calm and happy. For some reason, the meditation increased my sense of self confidence. I do not exactly know why, but perhaps it is because it puts into perspective one of the things that is important in life, and it gives me a way to control it.

      <h3>Tonglen Meditation
      </h3>
      <p>Not having a name for it, I have been performing a form of Tonglen Meditation for much of my past. As I breathed in the suffering of others, I imagine it as something that was or is, and as I exhale, I imagined what will be. I inhale the suffering of the present or past, and exhale the a future with less suffering. This motivates me and keeps me from straying into empty pleasures such as money. </p>

      <h3>SCARF Model-Phase 0
      </h3>
      <p>It is difficult to articulate how the SCARF Model applies to Phase-0 because the phase involved so much remote work and solidarity. But, certain aspects of SCARF, such as certainty and autonomy, were present on an individual level. For example, there were numerous times within the course where I was uncertain of a concept or method for solving a problem. This uncertainty caused some stress because I am heavily invested in learning how to code. I see coding as my future, so I want to be great at it. I care about my skill level, so it was imperative that I resolved my uncertainty. This motivated me to find solutions and get better. On a broader scale, I also faced uncertainty over whether or not I had made the right decision in coming to New Zealand and taking part in EDA. My mind constantly visualizes different pathways for my future, and I wonder how EDA will play into that future. I have resolved much of the stress induced by this uncertainty by resolving to focus on what I can control; mainly, I can control my effort and commitment to being a good person.</p>

      <h3>A Difficult Conversation</h3>
      <p>In my experiences with difficult conversations, honesty is the hardest and most important part. I try my best to balance this honesty with not hurting the other persons feelings. Difficult conversations are supposed to make situations better and not worse. Furthermore, I try to have these conversations as soon as possible. The longer I wait, the harder it is to bring up the topic. When I left America for New Zealand, I had to talk to one of my friends who I saw very often. I spent many weekends with her and we have great memories together. The gist of what I wanted to tell her is to not wait on me to come back, to not let my trip hold her life back in any way, and that, although I still care about her, she should not feel any obligation to me to remain single or committed to me. I used a few metaphors to hint at what I was saying, and then we discussed everything more concretely. We are still friends, and I hope we remain so.

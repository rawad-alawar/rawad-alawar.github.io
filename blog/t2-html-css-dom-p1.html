   <p> The relationship among HTML, CSS, and DOM is analogous to a shirt design. HTML represents physical elemnts of the shirt such as whether or not it will have long, short, or no sleeves, a collar, buttons, etc. CSS would represent the designs on the shirt such as the colors or graphical images. DOM would be like the tag on the shirt saying what it is made out of and where the materials were sourced from. So if you want to see what a website is made out of, you would open DOM. </p>
  <p>Boxifying is an essential component of HTML web design whereby images and texts are arranged on a web page within the framework of boxes. When developers are given a design, they break it up into boxes and develop each box.</p>
  <p>
    The box model uses the boxed outcomes of boxifying to compartmentalize a website into individual boxes.

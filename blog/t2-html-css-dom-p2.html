   <p> Grid based design is the breaking down of a website into rows and columns for the purpose of clearly representing the information on the page. It helps present information in an easy to follow manner.

Because people are accessing the internet from varied sources like telephones, tablets, and computers, web pages need to be able to adapt to the different screen sizes. Responsive webpages are designed to be view-able from multiple mediums and respond to different screen sizes.

Semantic structure is the use of intuitive tags that help organize an html. Some examples are h1 for headers or img for images.

I like how Udacity pointed us in the right direction with regard to using other websites to help us code. Udacity embraces uses sources like Stackoverflow to resolve coding problems.  </p>

    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Compared to HTML and CSS, Javascript is a language that makes things happen on webpages. Javascript is used to make a webpage interactive. It can be used to build websites that have tools such as metric to standard unit conversions.</p>

    <p>Control flow is the order that processes take place. For example, when going to the grocery store, first I would look for the highest quality product. If it is out of my budget, I would look for the next highest quality product until I find one within my budget. Else, I would not buy anything. Loops are instructions to do something until a condition is met. A real life example of a "for" loop would be running timing a run from lap 0 around a track to lap 5. </p>

    <p>An array is like a matrix where every element in the array can be accessed using bracket notation. In Javascript, the first element of an array is in the 0 spot, not 1. Objects allow you to access data using either bracket notation or dot notation.</p>

    <p>A function is like a mini program within you program. Given inputs, it executes a command or series of commands. Function are useful for simplifying code because they allow a coder to define a process once and call upon that process using just its name.</p>

    <h1>A Time I Got Blocked & Elegantly Solved the Problem</h1>
    <h2>The problem:</h2>
    <p>I got blocked on a problem that required us to make a chess board of any n by n size. I had no idea where to start.</p>

    <h2>Technique used to solve the problem:</h2>
    <p>I used a less detailed form of psuedocode to logically break down the problem. I pulled out a pencil and some paper and sketched out the board. I then assigned the rows and columns to a variable. Then, I wrote down the relationship between different coordinates on the board. Once I had a pattern down, I got to writing the code. After a couple of hours, I managed to solve the problem.</p>

    <h2>How I felt throughout the process:</h2>
    <p>I alternated between frustration and elation. Every breakthrough was so satisfying.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn:</h2>
    <p>I learned not to give up and not to go straight to asking for help.</p>

    <h1>Types of Problem Solving Techniques</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Psuedocode-I am comfortable using psuedocode to solve problems because it is one of the methods I learned in college.</li>
      <li>Trying Something- I have used this method for nearly every bit of code I have written because I am not 100% confident that what I type is what I want the code to do.</li>
      <li>Rubber Ducky Method- I don't use this method out of laziness.</li>
      <li>Reading Error Messages - I am confident in using this method and do so often. Whenever I receive an error message that I don't understand, I immediately Google it.</li>
      <li>Console.log- I use this method most often when running loops to see if the code is outputting in the order I want.</li>
      <li>Googling- I do this all the time.</li>
      <li>Asking for Help- I am still not fully confident when it comes to using Slack or other communication forms to ask others for help. 
      </li>
      <li>Improving with Reflection- I reflect quite a bit and go over the old material often. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Some JS Functions</h1>
    <p>.map() - this function is used on an array to change every element of an array in a particular manner.</p>
    <p>.filter() - takes an array as input and if the elements of that array fall under a defined criteria, those elements are then passed onto a new array</p>
    <p>.reduce() - the reduce function can be used on an array to sum up the values within that array.</p>

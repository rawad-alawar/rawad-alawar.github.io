    <h1>Scope in JS</h1>
    
    <p>The extent to which a variable can be used by a function or program is dictated by its scope. Some variables have global scope meaning they can be used within a function without having to be created again. A variable created outside of a function usually has global scope. If a variable is defined only within a function, then its scope is local to that function. This means that, unless it is returned by the function when it is called, this variable will be "invisible" to other functions. So, just to summarize, if a variable is declared outside of a function, it can be used within the function without redeclaring it. If a variable is declared within a function, its scope is local to that function.</p>
